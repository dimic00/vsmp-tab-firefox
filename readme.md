# VSMP Tab - Firefox plugin

## a movie played very slooooooooooooooowly in your browser tab

A new frame from a movie is displayed every hour in your browser.

Use [the Firefox plugin](https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/vsmp-tab/) and display current frame each time you open a new window or tab. It is safe for work.

Based on [Bryan Boyerâ€™s idea](https://medium.com/s/story/very-slow-movie-player-499f76c48b62).
